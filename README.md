# 📝 Java Notes App

A simple text-based notes manager built with Java.  
This app lets you add notes and view all saved notes using file I/O.

## 📂 Features
- Add notes (appends to a text file)
- View notes (reads and displays notes from the file)
- Command-line interface with a simple menu

## 🛠 How it Works
- Notes are saved in a file called `notes.txt` in the same directory as the program.
- Uses `FileWriter` for writing notes.
- Uses `BufferedReader` for reading notes.

This project is a Java-based console application that serves as a simple notes manager. It allows users to add text notes and view all previously saved notes. The notes are stored persistently in a local text file (notes.txt), making it easy to keep a record of thoughts, tasks, or reminders directly from the command line.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic file input/output (I/O) in Java using FileWriter for writing data and BufferedReader for reading data. It also shows how to build a simple menu-driven program that continuously interacts with the user until they choose to exit.
